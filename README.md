# Notes On Assignment

1. We have an overall dataset that requires us to unlock insights regarding the schools in a supposed city. We first begin with a high level overview that analyzes the performance of the overall district.
2. After analyzing the performance of the overall district, we consider the individual schools. To do so we must consider the alignment to ensure that the columns are assigned to the appropriate school.
3. Once we have constructed the overall school DataFrame, we can analyze the trends on a school by school basis. This allows us to draw some interesting conclusions about the performance of schools and the relation of performance to other variables.
